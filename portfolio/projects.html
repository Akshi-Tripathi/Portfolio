            Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is a classic example of a zero-sum game, meaning that the gain or loss of one player is exactly balanced by the loss or gain of the other. It is mostly common among children.
            Tic Tac Toe is often used as a teaching tool in computer science and artificial intelligence courses to illustrate concepts such as game trees, search algorithms, and decision-making strategies.
